The file has been split into twosequential parts, B1.dat, and B2.dat,; the lines in the files are spaced by 0.5 seconds. The first column is the heart rate, thesecond is the chest volume (respiration force), and the third is the blood oxygen concentration (measured by ear oximetry). Theheart rate was determined by measuring the time between the QRS complexes in the electrocardiogram, taking the inverse, andthen converting this to an evenly sampled record by interpolation.Reason for inclusion: 1. Heart rate variability There is growing (but still controversial) evidence that the observed variations in the heart ratemight be related to a low-dimensional governing mechanism; understanding this mechanism is obviously very important in order tounderstand its failures (ie, heart attacks). 2. Multi-dimensional data sets These data provide simultaneous measurements of a number of potentially interacting variables;it is an open question how best to use the extra information to learn about how the variables interact. Most importantly, thereis interest in verifying and understanding the coupling between respiration and the heart rate. 3. Non-stationary data These data were recorded with as much care as is possible, but the experimental system (the sleepingpatient) is obviously non-stationary.

The period of record varies widely from station to station with a mean of 21.5 years. The data are derived from the published UNESCO archives for river discharge and checked against information obtained from the Global Runoff Center in Koblenz, Germany, through the U.S. National Geophysical Data Center in Boulder, Colorado.No specific information is given in the original sources. Typically, river discharge is measured through the use of a rating curve that relates local water level height to water flow. This rating curve is used to estimate discharge from the observed water level.

The newly recovered records contain data before the 1870s, which is a period where, until recently, no instrumental data in Japan were believed to exist. Their addition to the previous backward extension of Japanese series, as based on the recently recovered intermittent Dejima/Nagasaki series 1819-1878, implies that the nineteenth-century extension of the Japanese instrumental record no longer contains major temporal gaps. The recovered data were used for a preliminary calculation of the west-Japan temperature (WJT) series, which is a representative temperature series for the area. The existence of a warm epoch in the 1850s over W-Japan and a downward temperature trend till the early twentieth century, as previously inferred from documentary data, is confirmed from the WJT data. The pressure data implies that the temperature differences between the nineteenth and twentieth centuries are at least partly caused by a change in atmospheric circulation.","I've removed the old block of data if there's an obvious section that's bad or is without readings.

Valid values may                         range from 0.0 to 95.0 hPa.  Missing observations are coded as 999;LCLD    is the low-cloud amount, estimated visually by an observer according to a                    10-point system (i.e., in tenths of sky cover).  A value of 0 indicates no                    low clouds present or <1/10 of the sky is covered with low clouds.  The                    gaps between individual cloud elements, typical of some cloud genera                    (e.g., stratocumulus and cumulus) are not to be included as part of the low                    cloud  cover estimate (i.e., they are counted as clear sky).  Missing                    observations are coded as 99;PRCP    is the precipitation amount to the nearest tenth of a millimeter.                    Observations considered valid may range from 0 to 5000 (0 mm to 500 mm).                    Missing observations are coded as 9999.  Rain gauges are positioned                    2 m above ground level, and were read at 0700 and 1900 LMT from 1936                    through 1965.  In 1946, the old-style gauge (exact type unknown) was                    replaced with the Tretyakov-type gauge (see Appendix A for the date of                    implementation at each site).  Beginning in 1966, gauges were read at                    0300, 0900, 1500, and 2100 MLT in timezone 2; at 0300, 0600, 1500,                    and 1800 MLT in zones 3-5; at 0300 and 1500 MLT in zones 6-8; at                    0000, 0300, 1200, and 1500 MLT in zones 9-11; and at 2100, 0300, 0900,                    and 1500 MLT in zone 12.  Also, beginning in 1966, wetting corrections                    of  0.2 mm were applied to each hourly measurement.  (Because four                    observations per day were collected at stations in timezones 2-5 and                    9-12, four corrections were counted in the calculation of daily totals;                    therefore, total daily corrections are higher for stations in these areas.)                    From 1966 onward, readings at some stations were also taken at the                    observing hours closest to 0800 and 2000 LMT.  Beginning in 1986,                    readings at 0300 and 1500 MLT were discontinued at all stations except                    those in timezone 2.  (The term ""timezone"" in the preceding corresponds                    to assigning the numbers 1-12 to 12 timezones stretching from west to                    east across the FSU.   The timezone of each station in this                    sense may be obtained by subtracting 1 from the value of the ZONE                    variable in the file timezone.dat.)PTND      is the pressure tendency value (i.e., the absolute difference between the                      current air pressure at the station and that which was observed 3 h before).                      The sign of PTND is indicated by the value of PCHR: if PCHR is equal to                      0, 1, 2, or 3, then PTND is positive; if PCHR is equal to 4 then PTND                      should equal 0; and, if PCHR is equal to 5, 6, 7, or 8, then PTND is                      negative.  Values are given in tenths of hPa; observations considered valid                      may range from 0.0 to 20.0 hPa, and a missing observation is coded as                      999);RH           is the relative humidity of the air (expressed in percent) as determined by                         use of a psychrometer.  Relative humidity is defined as the ratio of the                         observed vapor pressure to the saturation vapor pressure for the observed                         air temperature.  Values of observations may range from 0 to 100%.                         Missing observations are coded as 999;SLP          is the sea level pressure of the air (expressed in tenths of hPa) as                         determined by use of a barometer.  Because a station would rarely be able                         to position a barometer precisely at sea level, the air pressure measured at                         a station is ""reduced"" to sea level by using a standard barometric height                         formula.  Values of observations considered valid may range from 900.0 to                         1100.0 hPa.  At stations located above a certain elevation (500 m through                         1980; 800 m since 1981), air pressure is not reduced to sea level, but is                         assigned the missing code 99999;SOILT   is the soil surface temperature, expressed in whole degrees celsius.  Soil                    surface temperature is measured at a smooth, unshaded site that is devoid                    of vegetation.  When the ground is snow-covered, the thermometer  is                    placed on the snow surface and the temperature of the snow cover is                    measured.  Observations considered valid may range from -75 to +75°C.                    Missing observations are coded as 999;STAP    is the pressure of the air at station level (expressed in tenths of hPa) as                    determined by use of a barometer.  Values of observations considered valid                    may range from 600.0 to 1100.0 hPa.  Validity is of course assessed by                    considering factors such as the station's elevation above sea level,                    geographic location, season, and pressures at neighboring stations.                    Missing observations are coded as 99999;TCLD    is the total cloud amount, estimated visually by an observer according to a                    10-point system (i.e., in tenths of sky cover).  A value of 0 indicates no                    clouds present or <1/10 sky cover, a value of 10 indicates an overcast sky                    (with or without gaps amounting to <1/10 sky cover; see explanation of                    complement flag below), and a value of 99 indicates a missing                    observation.  The gaps between individual cloud elements, typical of some                    cloud genera (e.g., altocumulus and stratocumulus) are not to be included                    as part of the total cloud cover estimate (i.e., they are counted as clear sky);TDEW    is the dew point temperature in whole degrees celsius.  The dew point                    temperature is defined as the temperature to which moist air must be                    cooled, with air pressure and water vapor pressure held constant, in order                    that it just reach saturation with respect to the water in the air.  The dew                    point is determined by using a psychrometer.  Observations considered                    valid may range from -70° to +40°C.  Missing observations are coded as 999;VAPORP       is the water vapor pressure of the air [expressed in tenths of hectopascals                         (hPa)] as determined by use of a psychrometer.  The water vapor pressure                         is the partial pressure of the water vapor contained in the air.  Values of                         observations considered valid may range from 0.0 to 95.0 hPa.  Missing                         observations are coded as 999;VIS       is the horizontal visibility, given as a coded value indicating distance in                      km.  The horizontal visibility is defined as the maximum distance at which                      an absolutely black body of rather large angular dimensions (over 15                      angular min) can be distinguished against the background of the sky in                      daylight, or the distance at which an unfocused light source of a given                      intensity becomes indistinguishable at night.  Horizontal visibility depends                      on atmospheric phenomena.  Thus, in the fog it can be reduced to zero,                      while in clear arctic air it can reach hundreds of kilometers.  Coded values                      may range from 00 to 50 and from 56 to 99.  Codes 00-50 and 56-89 are                      used when visibility is measured using instruments; codes 90-99 are used                      when visibility is estimated visually.  The codes and their meanings are as                      follows:               00-50  =    indicates visibility in tenths of km (i.e., 0.0 km to 5.0 km).                           For example, 25 = 2.5 km (00 is the code for visibility less                           than 0.1 km);               51-55  =    not used;               56-80  =    the range 6 km to 30 km.  Visibility in whole kilometers                           may be determined by subtracting 50 from the code, e.g., a                           code of 65 indicates the visibility is 15 km;               81     =    35 km;               82     =    40 km;               83     =    45 km;               84     =    50 km;               85     =    55 km;               86     =    60 km;               87     =    65 km;               88     =    70 km;               89     =    >70 km;               90     =    <0.05 km;               91     =    0.05 km;               92     =    0.2 km;               93     =    0.5 km;               94     =    1 km (about 1/2 mile);               95     =    2 km (about 1 mile);               96     =    4 km (about 2 miles);               97     =    10 km (about 6 miles);               98     =    20 km (about 12 miles); and               99     =    >50 km (>30 miles).               If VIS = 99 with both the complement and quality flags set to 9 (see               below), the observation is missing.WDIR    is the direction from which the wind is blowing, as measured 10-12 m                    above ground level.

By about three years of age, gait appears relatively mature. However, it is unknown whether the dynamics of walking change beyond this age. Because stride dynamics depend on neural control, we hypothesized that gait dynamics would continue to develop beyond age three. To test this hypothesis, we measured the gait cycle duration on a stride-by-stride basis in healthy children (n=50) ages 3 to 14 years old, using a portable foot-switch device inserted inside of shoesThe following is the given description:The data contained here are from 50 healthy children ranging in age from 40 months to 163 months. Each data file is named with a subject identifier (1-50) and the subject's age (e.g., the file name 2-45.txt indicates that subject #2 is 45 months old).Each data file contains two columns of data in text format.
